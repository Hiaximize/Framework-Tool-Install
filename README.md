# Framework-Tool-Install

# This tool was written for a friend and I to get our installations of Kali up to snuff in the event of having to reinstall kali

# Using this tool is super simple. Download or pull to the root directory and then execute the script using 
# python install.py

# I plan to add to this project as I come across other must have frameworks
# That is all. Have a good day
